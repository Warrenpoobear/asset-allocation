## Current State <!-- auto -->

- Current phase: **Phase 11 — Owl scale-invariance (L16 resolved); scope-lock landed**
- Latest commit: `69cae5c` — docs(scope): scope-lock — PROJECT_SCOPE.md + Wake Robin reference architecture
- Branch: `main` (up-to-date with origin)
- Last pushed: 2026-05-02 16:03 ET
- Working tree: clean
- Tests: **225 passed** (`.venv/bin/pytest -p no:warnings`)
- Ruff: **22 errors** (17 auto-fixable) in `tests/` — non-blocking, lint debt
- Latest run set: `data/processed/runs/aa-*-20260502T200342Z-*` (5 scenarios)

## Open Gates

- [ ] **Phase 7 STAIRS PE adapter** — design locked at `993a751`. Implementation
      blocked until tests + invariants drafted alongside `pe/stairs_adapter.py`.
- [ ] **Phase 10 L14 transaction-cost diagnostics** — partially resolved at
      `49544f7` (report section); 4 cvxportfolio-gated tests still skipped /
      ModuleNotFoundError when extra not installed.
- [ ] **L19 spending-base realism** — explicitly out of scope for L16 fix; remains
      open. Phase-11 caveat surfaced verbatim in Owl regime report.
- [ ] **MODEL_DOCUMENTATION.md sweep** — confirm L16 status flips to
      `[RESOLVED 2026-05-02, Phase 11]` and that L19 caveat references are linked.
- [ ] **Determinism check** — re-run identical inputs must produce byte-identical
      `ledger.parquet` (SPEC §determinism).

## Active Limitations (open)

| ID  | Title                                                          | Doc line |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| L1  | PE timing scenarios mechanically affect returns                | 475      |
| L2  | Returns are NAV-dependent, not regime-dependent                | 490      |
| L3  | Stub-vs-riskfolio weights are not numerically comparable       | 502      |
| L5  | `source` as a PE-leg pairing key is fragile                    | 543      |
| L7  | Smoothing rule with `weight=0` freezes spending                | 586      |
| L9  | Heavy install footprint for `riskfolio` extra                  | 615      |
| L10 | `/mnt/c` filesystem unsuitable for `.venv`                     | 626      |
| L11 | Synthetic 2-row dummy returns frame in Riskfolio adapter       | 637      |
| L12 | Non-fatal "convert cov to PSD" warning                         | 694      |
| L14 | Only linear transaction cost is modeled (partial resolve)      | 984      |
| L17 | Cross-engine metric comparability is not meaningful            | 839      |
| L19 | Owl absolute-floor does NOT resolve spending-base realism      | (Ph11)   |

## Resolved Limitations

| ID  | Phase    | Resolved    | Title                                                  |
| --- | -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| L4  | Phase 5  | 2026-05-02  | Riskfolio default CMA fallback placeholder             |
| L6  | Phase 6  | 2026-05-02  | `correlation_shock` scenario omitted                   |
| L8  | Phase 8  | 2026-05-02  | Rebalancer treated PE as a liquid sleeve               |
| L13 | Phase 4b | 2026-05-02  | Cvxportfolio adapter had no path dependence            |
| L15 | Phase 4a | 2026-05-01  | Owl reacted to forecasted NAV, not realized NAV        |
| L16 | Phase 11 | 2026-05-02  | Owl scale-invariant in initial NAV (absolute guardrail)|
| L18 | Phase 4a | 2026-05-01  | Owl misread inflation shock as headroom                |

## Do Not Violate (governance invariants)

- **Ledger is sole state spine.** No sidecars, no hidden state.
- **CMA is baseline prior; scenarios are perturbations.** CMA baseline immutable.
- **No implementation before design lock.** Each phase ships a `docs(model): lock Phase N`
  commit before any implementation commit.
- **MODEL_DOCUMENTATION.md must be updated for any behavior change.** Doc-as-spec.
- **Determinism: identical inputs → byte-identical `ledger.parquet`.**
- **No overwriting run directories** — every run gets a new `run_id`.
- **No optimizer libs in Phase 1.** Phase-1 stub allocator only.
- **No STAIRS before L6 correlation_shock.** [SATISFIED — L6 resolved Phase 6.]
- **PROJECT_SCOPE.md is authoritative** for Wake Robin reference architecture
  (locked 2026-05-02 at `69cae5c`).

## Standard Commands

```bash
# Tests (clean, no warnings — 225 expected; 4 cvxportfolio-gated tests need extra)
.venv/bin/pytest -p no:warnings

# Lint
.venv/bin/ruff check src tests scripts
.venv/bin/ruff format --check src tests scripts

# Run scenario sweep
.venv/bin/python scripts/run_sfo_study.py --config configs/base.yaml

# Determinism: rerun and diff manifest hashes
.venv/bin/python scripts/run_sfo_study.py --config configs/base.yaml
# then compare two manifest.json files under data/processed/runs/
```

## Hermes Automations

| Cadence            | What runs                                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Daily 18:00 ET     | repo health: git status, pytest -q, ruff check, doc-diff     |
| On every push      | new-commits summary, behavior-change → doc-update enforcement|
| Before phase gate  | design-section presence check, open-L items, required tests  |

Cron jobs are registered separately in Hermes (see `cronjob list`).

## Update protocol

- **Auto sections** (`<!-- auto -->`) — overwritten by daily Hermes cron and post-push hook.
- **Active/Resolved Limitations** — updated when a commit message contains `resolves L#`
  or doc edit changes the `Status:` line of an `L#` heading.
- **Gates / Do Not Violate** — only edited when SPEC.md changes. Treat as protected.
- **Phase prose** — edit at phase-boundary commits (`docs(model): lock Phase N`).
